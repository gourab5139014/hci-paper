1. Introduction

- We are currently too focused on what we did.
- We should focus on motivation more.

- First two paragraphs - what we do on this paper
- The rest of the introduction
	- why this is needed
	- what is novel
- Last paragraph: summary of contributions

2. System Outline
This talks about moving parts of the system. Description of each phase constitutes of their purpose, inputs and outputs.

[Gourab: I agree with Oliver's point of a significant overlap between this section and S3. I think after we freeze the outline, we should move out the detailed description of each 
phase from sub-sections of S2 to S3. Is it okay to have a leaner S2?]

[Gokhan: Let's merge section 2 and 3. We start with current section 2; meaning, we will give a 1-2 paragraph design and moving parts introduction. We will follow with 1 sentence description of the phases within \tinysection{} styling. Then we are going to introduce every phase with every detail.

2.1 Clustering Phase
2.2 Session Identification phase
2.3 Session parameter detection phase


3. Detailed Design 
This dives deep into each phase. We talk about the techniques we have used - what has already been done before and what's new. We illustrate key techniques in details and talk about why these were choosen

3.1 Clustering
3.2 Session Identification
3.3 Pattern Matching
3.4 Resource Utilization

[Gokhan: Merge this section completely as described in the previous comment.]
